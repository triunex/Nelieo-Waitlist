# How to View Your Waitlist Database

## Your Database Location

**Production (Render):** `/opt/render/project/src/lumina_waitlist.db`
**Local:** `n:\lumina-search-flow-main\waitlist\lumina_waitlist.db`

---

## Method 1: View Locally (Easiest)

Run this command in your waitlist folder:

```bash
cd N:\lumina-search-flow-main\waitlist
node view-database.js
```

This will show all your waitlist entries in a nice table format.

---

## Method 2: Via API (Production)

I've added a protected admin endpoint to view all entries.

### Setup:
1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your service → Environment
2. Add a new variable:
   ```
   ADMIN_SECRET=your_secret_password_here
   ```
   (Choose any strong password)

### Usage:
Visit this URL in your browser (replace with your secret):
```
https://nelieo.onrender.com/api/admin/waitlist?secret=your_secret_password_here
```

This will return JSON with all your waitlist entries:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 10,
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "company": "Acme Inc",
      "use_case": "customer-support",
      "created_at": "2025-11-05 10:30:00"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Method 3: Download DB from Render (Advanced)

If you want to download the database file directly:

1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your service
2. Click "Shell" (requires paid plan) OR
3. Use the export script:

```bash
# In your local waitlist folder:
node export-waitlist.js
```

This creates a CSV file with all entries.

---

## Quick Stats Endpoint (Public)

To just see the count:
```
https://nelieo.onrender.com/api/waitlist/count
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 10
}
```

## Database Schema

Your SQLite database has these tables:

### `waitlist` table:
- `id` - Auto-incrementing primary key
- `name` - User's full name
- `email` - User's email (UNIQUE)
- `company` - Company name (optional)
- `use_case` - What they'll use Nelieo for
- `created_at` - Signup timestamp

### `waitlist_analytics` table:
- `id` - Auto-incrementing primary key
- `event_type` - Type of event
- `email` - User's email
- `metadata` - JSON metadata
- `created_at` - Event timestamp

---

## Backup Your Database

**Recommended:** Set up automatic backups

1. Install Litestream (free):
   ```bash
   # On Render, add to your Dockerfile or use the API
   ```

2. Or manually backup:
   ```bash
   # Copy DB file to your computer
   scp render:/opt/render/project/src/lumina_waitlist.db ./backup/
   ```

3. Or use the export script:
   ```bash
   node export-waitlist.js
   # This creates waitlist_export.csv
   ```

## Questions?

- To view data: Use `node view-database.js` locally
- For production: Use the admin API endpoint
- For backups: Use `node export-waitlist.js`
